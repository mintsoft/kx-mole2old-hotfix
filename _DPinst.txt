[ Some Command-Line Switches] :
-------------------------------

/c     Display the text of log messages in the Command Prompt window(aka debug).

/f     Sets the Force IfDriverIsNotBetter flag to ON, which configures DPInst to install a driver on a device even if the driver that is currently installed on the device is a better match than the new driver.

/h     Configures DPInst to display help information about DPInst command-line options. If DPInst was called at a command prompt, DPInst displays the help text in the Command Prompt window; otherwise, DPInst displays the help text in a message box.

/path  Sets the DPInst working directory to DPInst-working-directory. DPInst searches for driver packages in the DPInst working directory and in subdirectories under the working directory that are specified by subDirectory XML elements in a DPInst descriptor file. For more information about how to set the DPInst working directory and specifying subdirectories under the working directory, see Specifying the Location of a Driver Package.

/q     Silent mode
